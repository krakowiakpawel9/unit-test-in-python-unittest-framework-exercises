### unittest framework

The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

To achieve this, unittest supports some important concepts in an object-oriented way:

* test fixture
* test case
* test suite
* test runner

Unit testing is one of the most popular software testing methods today, so writing unit tests is a must-have skill for any software developer. This is a great test for people who want to become a Python Developer. Exercises are also a good test before the interview. Many popular topics were covered in this course.
